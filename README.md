# Figma Split Vectors Plugin

Tired of copying vector parts to customize them?
Try this plugin to speedup your work!

You can Split Vectors:

➡ by Fills. Select Vector with more than one fill region.

➡ by Shapes. Select Vector with more than one separated shapes inside.

➡ by Segments. Select Vector with more than one segment inside.

Known issues:
Due to API limitations, it is currently impossible to get all possible fill areas automatically after filling a Vector, so you need to manually add fills with Paint Bucket (B) before splitting.
But soon I'll do it on the plugin side 😜
