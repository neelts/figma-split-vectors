# Figma Split Vectors plugin

Tired of copying vector parts to customize them?
Try this plugin to speedup your work!

You can Split Vectors:

âž¡ by Fills. Select Vector with more than one fill region.

âž¡ by Shapes. Select Vector with more than one separated shapes inside.

âž¡ by Segments. Select Vector with more than one segment inside.

Known issues:
Due to API limitations, it is currently impossible to get all possible fill areas automatically after filling a Vector, so you need to manually add fills with Paint Bucket (B) before splitting.
But soon I'll do it on the plugin side ðŸ˜œ
